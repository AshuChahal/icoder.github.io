    <P class="app">An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer
        programs. It is
        a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that
        describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system
        that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the
        specification or to the implementation.

    </P>
    <p class="app"> <strong>Libraries and frameworks</strong><br>
        The interface to a software library is one type of API. The API describes and prescribes the "expected behavior"
        (a specification) while the library is an "actual implementation" of this set of rules.

        A single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that
        share the same programming interface.

        The separation of the API from its implementation can allow programs written in one language to use a library
        written in another. For example, because Scala and Java compile to compatible bytecode, Scala developers can
        take advantage of any Java API.[14]

        API use can vary depending on the type of programming language involved. An API for a procedural language such
        as Lua could consist primarily of basic routines to execute code, manipulate data or handle errors while an API
        for an object-oriented language, such as Java, would provide a specification of classes and its class
        methods.[15][16] Hyrum's law [17] states that "With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter
        what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody."
        Meanwhile, several studies show that most applications that use an API tend to use a small part of the API.[18]
        API use actually varies depending on the number of users, as well as on the popularity of the API.[19]

        Language bindings are also APIs. By mapping the features and capabilities of one language to an interface
        implemented in another language, a language binding allows a library or service written in one language to be
        used when developing in another language.[20]

        Tools such as SWIG and F2PY, a Fortran-to-Python interface generator, facilitate the creation of such
        interfaces.[21]

        An API can also be related to a software framework: a framework can be based on several libraries implementing
        several APIs, but unlike the normal use of an API, the access to the behavior built into the framework is
        mediated by extending its content with new classes plugged into the framework itself.

        Moreover, the overall program flow of control can be out of the control of the caller and in the framework's
        hands by inversion of control or a similar. <br>
        <br>

        <strong>Operating systems</strong> <br>
        An API can specify the interface between an application and the operating system.[24] POSIX, for example,
        specifies a set of common APIs that aim to enable an application written for a POSIX conformant operating system
        to be compiled for another POSIX conformant operating system.

        Linux and Berkeley Software Distribution are examples of operating systems that implement the POSIX APIs.[25]

        Microsoft has shown a strong commitment to a backward-compatible API, particularly within its Windows API
        (Win32) library, so older applications may run on newer versions of Windows using an executable-specific setting
        called "Compatibility Mode".[26]

        An API differs from an application binary interface (ABI) in that an API is source code based while an ABI is
        binary based. For instance, POSIX provides APIs while the Linux Standard Base provides an ABI.[27][28] <br>

        <strong> Remote APIs</strong> <br>
        Remote APIs allow developers to manipulate remote resources through protocols, specific standards for
        communication that allow different technologies to work together, regardless of language or platform. For
        example, the Java Database Connectivity API allows developers to query many different types of databases with
        the same set of functions, while the Java remote method invocation API uses the Java Remote Method Protocol to
        allow invocation of functions that operate remotely but appear local to the developer.[29][30]

        Therefore, remote APIs are useful in maintaining the object abstraction in object-oriented programming; a method
        call, executed locally on a proxy object, invokes the corresponding method on the remote object, using the
        remoting protocol, and acquires the result to be used locally as a return value. <br>

        A modification of the proxy object will also result in a corresponding modification of the remote object.[31]
        <br>

        <strong> Web APIs </strong> <br>
        Main article: Web API <br>
        Web APIs are the defined interfaces through which interactions happen between an enterprise and applications
        that use its assets, which also is a service-level agreement (SLA) to specify the functional provider and expose
        the service path or URL for its API users. An API approach is an architectural approach that revolves around
        providing a program interface to a set of services to different applications serving different types of
        consumers.[32]

        When used in the context of web development, an API is typically defined as a set of specifications, such as
        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response
        messages, usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. An example
        might be a shipping company API that can be added to an eCommerce-focused website to facilitate ordering
        shipping services and automatically include current shipping rates, without the site developer having to enter
        the shipper's rate table into a web database. While "web API" historically has been virtually synonymous with
        web service, the recent trend (so-called Web 2.0) has been moving away from Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
        based web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) towards more direct representational state transfer
        (REST) style web resources and resource-oriented architecture (ROA).[33] Part of this trend is related to the
        Semantic Web movement toward Resource Description Framework (RDF), a concept to promote web-based ontology
        engineering technologies. Web APIs allow the combination of multiple APIs into new applications known as
        mashups.[34] In the social media space, web APIs have allowed web communities to facilitate sharing content and
        data between communities and applications. In this way, content that is created in one place dynamically can be
        posted and updated to multiple locations on the web.[35] For example, Twitter's REST API allows developers to
        access core Twitter data and the Search API provides methods for developers to interact with Twitter Search and
        trends data.[36]
